2. if the user in southern hemispere and between October and march
or if the user in nothern hemisphere and between march and October
then it show the other content


App chalange
1.need to get the user physical location
2. need to determine the current month
3.need to change text and styling based on 
Location and month



we are going to make two component 
App -  has code to determine location and month
SeasonDisplay- show the different text.icons based on props


for getting the user geographical location we are using Source on MDN
APIs-   

         window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        (position)=>console.log(position),    #this run  when we able to find the location
        (err)=>console.log(err)    #this show when it not able to detect the location
    ); 

in this when we are want to get the geolocation then it take time 
there no way to wait in functional component
